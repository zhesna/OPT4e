### OPT4e:

#### (Optimal-features Predictor for T4SS Effector proteins)

(UPDATE: From now on, please use this url for downloading OPT4e:

)

OPT4e is a software package written in python3 for the purpose of optimal prediction of type IV secretion system effector proteins among the input set of protein sequences. (note that this software is based on input protein sequence(s) and there is no need to provide the whole genome of a bacterial pathogen as an input.)


**Getting Started with OPT4e**:

OPT4e has three different versions provided for three types of operating systems and a manual is provided for each version. Each manual includes the installation procedure (which is one-time) and then running OPT4e.

Please make sure to go through OPT4e  manual for each version.

(In order to download any of the files, please click on it and in the new openned page, use the download button.)

Thank you for using OPT4e.
